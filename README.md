# Cotton-Disease-Prediction
A deep learning-based project for detecting and classifying cotton plant diseases using a hybrid ShuffleNetV2 + MHSA model in PyTorch. The model leverages transfer learning and attention mechanisms for enhanced accuracy on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.



## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Cotton Plant Disease]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhamur/cotton-plant-disease/data))
- **Classes**:
  - Diseased cotton leaf
  - Diseased cotton plant
  - Fresh cotton leaf
  - Fresh cotton plant

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The core model integrates:
- **ShuffleNetV2**: A lightweight CNN pretrained on ImageNet.
- **MHSA (Multi-Head Self Attention)**: Added after the feature extraction layer to enhance spatial and contextual understanding.

> The classifier head is fully customized with dropout and linear layers for classification.
